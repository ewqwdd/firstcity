## More then just a care provider

First City Care Group is striving to become ‘more than just a care provider’. We want to work with you to deliver holistic care solutions that enable you to achieve your goals while ensuring your care needs are met.

We are currently actively working with technology providers, community organisations and other community care providers to develop a more reactive model of community care that can flex based on your day-to-day needs. We are keen to involve the people we support in this work, and you can find out more about [getting involved here](/contact-us).

## Quality - CQC

First City Care Group prides itself on providing the highest standards of regulated care. We are rated outstanding by the Care Quality Commission and are one of the largest single sites to have been awarded this rating.

We know that we don’t always get things right, but we are committed to working with the people we support when things go wrong to fix things.

We have established and proven procedures in relation to the provision of a range of care solutions and take quality very seriously. Ranging from ensuring we meet data standards to administering medications, you can rest assured that our services are safe and quality assured.
